**Description**

Python implementations of subsampled and sketched regularized Newton's methods for unconstrained continous (non- and convex) optimization. The original code implemented:

a) The **Trust Region** framework as presented in Conn et al. 2000

b) The **Adaptive Cubic Regularization (ARC)** framework as presented in Cartis et al. 2011

c) The **Subsampled Cubic Regularization (SCR)** method presented in Kohler and Lucchi, 2017

We additionally implement: 

d) The **Newton Sketch (NS)** method presented in Pilanci and Wainwright, 2017

e) The **Sketched Cubic Regularization (SkCR)** method discussed in our report

f) The **Sketched Affine-Invariant Cubic Newton (SkAICN)** method discussed in our report
